*palserver.ps1* is a PowerShell script designed to assist in deploying a Palworld server on Windows.

   1.1 Precede the path to *palserver.ps1* with an "&" symbol to run the script.  
2. After the server installation, try running PalServer.exe.
   2.1 The default location of PalServer.exe is "C:\palworld\PalServer.exe".  
3. If you encounter an error related to VC++ or DirectX, execute *VC+DX.ps1*.  
4. You should now be able to run the Palworld server.
